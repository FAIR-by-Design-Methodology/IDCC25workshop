# Skills4EOSC Recognition Framework

Recognising the newly obtained skills is of great importance in the life long learning process. It is essential that there are mechanisms in place that can help learners obtain digital credentials reflecting their current skillsets.

The Skills4EOSC Recognition Framework is designed to support the professional development and recognition of skills within the Open Science ecosystem. As Open Science becomes increasingly integral to research and data management across Europe, there is a growing need for a consistent and reliable way to certify the skills and competencies of professionals involved in this field. The framework addresses this need by providing a standardized approach to the use of digital credentials.

## Key Aspects of the Skills4EOSC Recognition Framework:

1. Digital Credentials:

The framework leverages digital credentials, such as badges and certificates, to provide tangible, verifiable proof of skills. These credentials are awarded based on specific achievements, such as completing training programs, passing assessments, or demonstrating particular competencies.

Digital credentials are designed to be easily shareable, allowing professionals to include them in their CVs, LinkedIn profiles, or other online portfolios. This enhances the visibility and recognition of their skills across the European research community and beyond.

2. Supporting Open Science Professionals:

The framework is tailored to meet the needs of various stakeholders in the Open Science ecosystem, including researchers, data stewards, librarians, and other research support staff.

It recognizes both formal and informal learning, offering flexibility in how skills are acquired and validated. This is particularly important in a rapidly evolving field like Open Science, where new tools, methods, and practices are constantly emerging.

3. For Instructors:
The framework provides instructors with a way to certify the competencies they impart to their learners, helping to establish their credibility and expertise in Open Science.

4. Employer Recognition Across Europe:

One of the core goals of the framework is to ensure that these digital credentials are recognized by employers across Europe. By establishing a common standard, the framework makes it easier for employers to assess and validate the skills of potential hires, regardless of their location or the specific training programs they have completed.

This cross-border recognition is crucial for fostering mobility and collaboration within the European Research Area (ERA), enabling professionals to move between countries and institutions while maintaining the value of their credentials.

5. Integration with Existing Initiatives:

The Skills4EOSC Recognition Framework is designed to align with other European initiatives, such as the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC), the European Skills, Competences, Qualifications, and Occupations (ESCO) framework, and the European Digital Credentials for Learning (EDCL) system. This integration helps ensure that the credentials are interoperable and widely accepted.

6. Promoting Lifelong Learning:

The framework encourages lifelong learning by recognizing continuous professional development. Professionals can earn credentials as they acquire new skills over time, helping them stay current with the latest developments in Open Science and related fields.

7. Contributing to a Sustainable Open Science Ecosystem:

By promoting the recognition of skills and competencies, the Skills4EOSC Recognition Framework contributes to the sustainability of the Open Science ecosystem. It supports the development of a skilled workforce that can drive the adoption and implementation of Open Science practices across Europe.

## Activity

Objectives:

- Participants apply their understanding of the Skills4EOSC framework and digital credentials (Open Badges and European Digital Credentials) to practical scenarios.
- Participants discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different credential types in specific contexts.
- Participants consider how the Skills4EOSC framework can inform credential design and evaluation.

[Activity Handout](./attachments/Scenarios+Guidelines_RF.pdf)

Steps:

1. Select Scenario
    - choose one scenario to focus on for the activity
2. Small Group Work
    - discuss the scenario and answer the guiding questions, focusing on applying the knowledge from the preceding presentation
3. Group Sharing & Discussion
    - share  key findings and recommendations per scenario
    - docus on the reasoning behind their choices regarding digital credential types and how the Skills4EOSC framework influenced their thinking.
    - discuss common themes and contrasting approaches between the two scenarios. 
        - What are the key considerations for choosing one type of digital credential over another? 
        - How can the Skills4EOSC framework help both training providers and those seeking training?

**Scenario A: Upskilling Course Development**

- Context: A training centre wants to develop a new self-paced online course on "Data Visualization for Research." They plan to offer digital credentials upon successful completion.
- Questions: 
    - What type of digital credential (Open Badge or European Digital Credential, or a combination) would you recommend for this course and why?
    - How can the Skills4EOSC framework be used to define the learning outcomes and competencies for this course, and how can this information be reflected in the digital credential?
    - What are the advantages and disadvantages of your chosen credential type for both the training center and the learners?
    - What information should be included in the digital credential to make it valuable and recognizable within the EOSC ecosystem?

**Scenario B: Trainer Recruitment**

- Context: A research institute is looking to hire a trainer to deliver a workshop on "Research Data Management." Applicants are asked to provide examples of their previous training experience, often including digital credentials.
- Questions: 
    - How can the institute evaluate the different types of digital credentials presented by the applicants (Open Badges, European Digital Credentials, or others)?
    - What criteria should they use to determine the validity and relevance of these credentials in relation to the workshop requirements?
    - How can the Skills4EOSC framework help the institute identify the key competencies needed for the trainer role and assess whether the applicantsâ€™ credentials demonstrate these competencies?
    - What are the potential challenges in relying on digital credentials for trainer selection, and how can these be addressed?

## Summary

The Skills4EOSC Recognition Framework aims to standardize the use of digital credentials to provide Open Science professionals, both instructors and learners, with verifiable proof of their skills. This framework also enables employers across Europe to recognize and validate these competencies, ensuring consistent standards and fostering professional development in the field of Open Science.

Do not forget that the final version of the Recognition Framework is due to be out in March 2025.
