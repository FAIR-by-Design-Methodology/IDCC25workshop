## Activity

This activity aims to enhance participants' understanding of open science principles and their practical application by engaging them in the collaborative development of targeted training sessions. Through this process, participants will develop essential skills in needs assessment, curriculum design, resource utilization, problem-solving, and effective communication, while fostering a deeper understanding of open science principles and their impact across diverse professional contexts.

**Instructions**

1. Participants divide into groups, each representing a different professional profile (e.g., Policy Makers, Data Stewards, Undergraduates, PhD students, Early Career Researchers, Senior Researchers, Funders, RI professionals, etc). 
2. Training Plan Development
    - Identify Key Concepts: Select and write down key open science concepts relevant to your target audience.
    - Determine Training Format: Decide on a suitable training format (e.g., presentation, workshop, interactive exercises).
    - Define Learning Objectives: Clearly state the main (2-3) learning objectives for your training.
    - Plan Activities: Brainstorm and outline engaging activities to support learning (e.g., group discussions, case studies, hands-on exercises).
    - Identify Resources: Utilize the provided "Existing Open Science Training Resources" list and brainstorm additional resources.
    - Address Challenges: Identify potential challenges in preparing/adopting training material and implementing training for this group and brainstorm potential solutions.
    - Document: Organize the information using different sections and color coding (suggested ones: Group Name & Profile, Training Title, Learning Objectives, Training Plan Outline, Challenges & Solutions, Existing Material Utilization). Each group will complete one Whiteboard.
3. Each group will present their training plan to the larger group.

## Summary

At the end provide a short summary of the main points of the learning unit (these are the key takeaways that help reflect on the learning outcomes)
