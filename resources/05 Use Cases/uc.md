# Skills4EOSC Example Developed Training Materials

Communicating science effectively is becoming increasingly crucial in empowering society to take evidence-informed decisions to address its challenges, especially in the context of evidence-informed policymaking (often referred to as “science4policy”).

SKILLS4EOSC has developed a two-day interactive workshop that aims to enhance researchers' communication skills and facilitate dialogue with policymakers by upskilling communication competencies through theoretical learning and practical application.

## Activity

This activity aims to enhance participants' understanding of open science principles and their practical application by engaging them in the collaborative development of targeted training sessions. Through this process, participants will develop essential skills in needs assessment, curriculum design, resource utilization, problem-solving, and effective communication, while fostering a deeper understanding of open science principles and their impact across diverse professional contexts.

**Instructions**

1. Participants divide into groups, each representing a different professional profile (e.g., Policy Makers, Data Stewards, Undergraduates, PhD students, Early Career Researchers, Senior Researchers, Funders, RI professionals, etc). 
2. Training Plan Development
    - Identify Key Concepts: Select and write down key open science concepts relevant to your target audience.
    - Determine Training Format: Decide on a suitable training format (e.g., presentation, workshop, interactive exercises).
    - Define Learning Objectives: Clearly state the main (2-3) learning objectives for your training.
    - Plan Activities: Brainstorm and outline engaging activities to support learning (e.g., group discussions, case studies, hands-on exercises).
    - Identify Resources: Utilize the provided "Existing Open Science Training Resources" list and brainstorm additional resources.
    - Address Challenges: Identify potential challenges in preparing/adopting training material and implementing training for this group and brainstorm potential solutions.
    - Document: Organize the information using different sections and color coding (suggested ones: Group Name & Profile, Training Title, Learning Objectives, Training Plan Outline, Challenges & Solutions, Existing Material Utilization). Each group will complete one Whiteboard.
3. Each group will present their training plan to the larger group.

## Summary

The final set of courses in the Open Science and Evidence-Informed Decision-Making curriculum follows a structured approach that combines self-paced learning with interactive live sessions to ensure an engaging and comprehensive learning experience.

1. Self-Paced Component
    - Delivered through Moodle, allowing learners to progress at their own pace.
    - Includes pre-recorded lectures, readings, and interactive activities (e.g., quizzes, case studies).
    - Different formats of material were provided (Video presentations with voiceover, PPTs to facilitate reuse, PDFs to facilitate navigation and sharing, Instructor’s notes and narrative for easier understanding of the narrated video)
    - Participants complete knowledge checks before moving to the live session.

2. Live Interactive Sessions
    - Conducted online via platforms such as BigBlueButton integrated into Moodle.
    - Features recaps, interactive discussions, and Q&A to clarify concepts from the self-paced section.
    - Uses Wooclap for icebreakers and interactive polling to engage participants.
    - Includes group activities, case discussions, and role-playing for practical application.
