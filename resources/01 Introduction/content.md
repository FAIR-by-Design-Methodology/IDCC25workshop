In the rapidly evolving landscape of research, Open Science has become a pivotal force driving transparency, collaboration, and innovation. However, the transition to Open Science requires researchers and research support personnel to develop a specific set of skills, create educational resources that adhere to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles, and establish recognition mechanisms that validate these efforts.

This workshop is designed to equip participants with the essential skills necessary for successful engagement in Open Science by taking advantage of the Skills4EOSC project outputs. Through interactive sessions, attendees will learn how to use the Minimum Viable Skills profiles, develop FAIR-compliant learning materials, and employ a recognition framework to acknowledge and reward these competencies.

Additionally, the workshop will promote developed Skills4EOSC learning materials, providing participants with valuable resources they can integrate into their work. By the end of the session, attendees will be empowered with practical tools and knowledge to advance Open Science practices within their own communities.

## Target Audience

Researchers, educators, and policymakers involved in open science initiatives, as well as anyone interested in developing skills and educational resources that align with FAIR principles.

## Workshop Objectives

1. Define Minimum Viable Skills for Open Science:
    - Introduce the concept of minimum viable skillsets (MVS) necessary for engaging in open science.
    - Discuss how these skillsets can be used to develop roles within the research ecosystem.
2. Develop FAIR-by-Design Learning Materials:
    - Provide a methodology to create educational resources that are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR).
    - Share examples of FAIR learning materials and discuss best practices for their development.
3. Skills4EOSC Recognition Framework:
    - Explore ways to recognise and validate the acquisition of these skills through open badges, certificates, European digital credentials, or other forms of acknowledgement.
    - Present examples that implemented the Skills4EOSC recognition framework.
4. Promote Existing Learning Materials:
    - Highlight the newly developed Skills4EOSC learning resources that participants can utilise.
    - Provide guidance on how to integrate these resources into their own educational practices.
5. Hands-On Activities:
    - Engage participants in group activities where they select an MVS from the current catalogue and discuss how it could be applied in their contexts.
    - Provide feedback on steps to adopting the methods and barriers to this.

## Expected Outcomes:

- Participants will have a clear understanding of the MVS necessary for open science.
- Participants will gain practical experience in using the FAIR-by-design methodology for learning materials development.
- Participants will learn how to use a recognition framework that can be adapted to their specific needs.
- Participants will be aware of and equipped to use existing open science learning resources.
