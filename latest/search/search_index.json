Through interactive sessions, attendees will learn how to use the Minimum Viable Skills profiles, develop FAIR-compliant learning materials, and employ a recognition framework to acknowledge and reward these competencies. Target audience Researchers, educators, and policymakers involved in open science initiatives, as well as anyone interested in developing skills and educational resources that align with FAIR principles. Expertise Level / Skill Level: Beginner Primary Language: English Access Cost: N Prerequisites none Duration full day workshop Workshop objectives Define Minimum Viable Skills for Open Science Develop FAIR-by-Design Learning Materials Validate skills using the Skills4EOSC Recognition Framework Reuse Existing Learning Materials developed by Skills4EOSC Keywords Open Science, Skills, FAIR, Recognition Agenda: Training Schedule - Training Structure Date/Time Topic 8:30-9:00 Introduction 9:00-10:00 Defining Minimum Viable Skills 10:00-10:30 coffee break 10:30-12:00 Developing FAIR-by-Design Learning Materials 12:00-13:00 lunch break 13:00-14:00 The Skills4EOSC Recognition Framework 14:00-14:30 coffee break 14:30-15:30 Case Studies and Examples 15:30-16:00 Conclusion and Wrap-up Resources and Materials All resources are published in these materials.

If you are reusing images or text clear attribution should be provided as in the example above. Same applies in case of reusing text or other type of content. Be careful to follow the attribution rules as provided by the image source (in the example above it is Pixabay). Accessibility Using headings and subheadings, lists and alternative text for images is extremely important so as to ensure accessibility of the content for people with impairments. Also, take care to choose the appropriate color pallette for images.
